Bamazon

Goal is creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills learned. The app shows the customer what items are available and the price. The customer picks an item to buy and then is prompted to provide the quantity of that item wanted to buy.

Their response will cross check the SQL database and compare to the quantity in stock. If enough, in stock, the stock will deduct the amount requested.
